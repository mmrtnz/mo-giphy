This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation
- Pull down this code from github
- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Create a file `.env` at the root level. This is used to store environment variables and is not created by default for security reasons. Please shoot my an email at muhammad_martinez@yahoo.com for its contents.

### To Run Locally:
- In your terminal, source the file by running `. .env`
- Start the API server by running `node server/app.js`
- In a separate tab of your terminal, start the app by running `yarn start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
